You will need to manipulate you existing spatial geometries to do this using either st_union or st_combine depending on the situation. In all cases, since we are after distances to borders, we will need to cast (st_cast) our MULTIPPOLYGON geometries to MULTILINESTRING geometries.

    "text": "Question 1:\nHere we will prepare five tessellated surfaces from CONUS and write a function to plot them in a descriptive way.\n\nStep 1.1\nFirst, we need a spatial file of CONUS counties. For future area calculations we want these in an equal area projection (EPSG:5070).\nTo achieve this:\nget an sf object of US counties (AOI::aoi_get(state = “conus”, county = “all”))\ntransform the data to EPSG:5070\n\n\nCode\nconus &lt;- AOI::aoi_get(state = \"conus\", county = \"all\") %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs = 5070)\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.2\nFor triangle based tessellations we need point locations to serve as our “anchors”.\nTo achieve this:\ngenerate county centroids using st_centroid\nSince, we can only tessellate over a feature we need to combine or union the resulting 3,108 POINT features into a single MULTIPOINT feature\nSince these are point objects, the difference between union/combine is mute\n\n\nCode\ncentroid &lt;- conus %&gt;%\n  st_centroid() %&gt;%\n  st_combine()\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.3\nMake a voroni tessellation over your county centroids (MULTIPOINT)\n\n\nCode\nvoronoi &lt;- st_voronoi(centroid, envelope = st_union(conus)) %&gt;%\n  st_collection_extract(\"POLYGON\") %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf() %&gt;%\n  mutate(id = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  st_cast()\n\n\nMake a triangulated tessellation over your county centroids (MULTIPOINT)\n\n\nCode\ntriangulated &lt;- st_triangulate(centroid) %&gt;%\n  st_collection_extract(\"POLYGON\") %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf() %&gt;%\n  mutate(id = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  st_cast()\n\n\nMake a gridded coverage with n = 70, over your counties object\n\n\nCode\ngrid &lt;- st_make_grid(conus, n = 70, what = \"polygons\", square = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf() %&gt;%\n  mutate(id = row_number ()) %&gt;%\n  st_cast()\n\n\nMake a hexagonal coverage with n = 70, over your counties object In addition to creating these 4 coverage’s we need to add an ID to each tile.\n\n\nCode\nhex &lt;- st_make_grid(conus, n = 70, what = \"polygons\", square = FALSE) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf() %&gt;%\n  mutate(id = row_number ()) %&gt;%\n  st_cast()\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.4\nIf you plot the above tessellations you’ll see the triangulated surfaces produce regions far beyond the boundaries of CONUS.\nWe need to cut these boundaries to CONUS border.\nTo do this, we will call on st_intersection, but will first need a geometry of CONUS to serve as our differencing feature. We can get this by unioning our existing county boundaries.\n\n\nCode\nunion &lt;- st_union(conus) \n\nvoronoi_union &lt;- st_intersection(voronoi, union)\n\ntriangulated_union &lt;- st_intersection(triangulated, union)\n\ngrid_union &lt;- st_intersection(grid, union)\n\nhex_union &lt;- st_intersection(hex, union)\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.5\nWith a single feature boundary, we must carefully consider the complexity of the geometry. Remember, the more points our geometry contains, the more computations needed for spatial predicates our differencing.

What are the consequences of doing this computationally? ##### 10,715 points. *Answer the second part of this question later…\nFinally, use your simplified object to crop the two triangulated tessellations with st_intersection:\n\n\nCode\nvoronoi_simple &lt;- st_intersection(voronoi, simple)\ntriangulated_simple &lt;- st_intersection(triangulated, simple)\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.6\nThe last step is to plot your tessellations. We don’t want to write out 5 ggplots (or mindlessly copy and paste 😄)\nInstead, lets make a function that takes an sf object as arg1 and a character string as arg2 and returns a ggplot object showing arg1 titled with arg2.\nFor this function:\nThe name can be anything you chose, arg1 should take an sf object, and arg2 should take a character string that will title the plot\nIn your function, the code should follow our standard ggplot practice where your data is arg1, and your title is arg2\nThe function should also enforce the following:\na white fill\na navy border\na size of 0.2\n`theme_void``\na caption that reports the number of features in arg1\nYou will need to paste character stings and variables together.\n\n\nCode\ntess_plot = function(object, title_text) {\n  ggplot(data = object) +\n  geom_sf(fill = \"white\", color = \"navy\", size = 0.2) +\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(\n    title = title_text,\n    caption = paste(\"number of features:\", nrow(object)))\n}\n\ntess_plot(voronoi_simple, \"voronoi plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.7 Use your new function to plot each of your tessellated surfaces and the original county data (5 plots in total):\n\n\nCode\ntess_plot(conus, \"CONUS County Boundaries\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntess_plot(voronoi_simple, \"Voronoi Tessellation\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntess_plot(triangulated_simple, \"Triangulated Tessellation\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntess_plot(grid_union, \"Square Grid Tessellation\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntess_plot(hex_union, \"Hexagonal Grid Tessellation\")"

For future area calculations we want these in an equal area projection (EPSG:5070).\nTo achieve this:\n\nget an sf object of US counties (AOI::aoi_get(state = “conus”, county = “all”))\ntransform the data to EPSG:5070\n\n\nconus &lt;- AOI::aoi_get(state = \"conus\", county = \"all\") %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs = 5070)\n\n\n\nStep 1.2\nFor triangle based tessellations we need point locations to serve as our “anchors”.\nTo achieve this:\n\ngenerate county centroids using st_centroid\nSince, we can only tessellate over a feature we need to combine or union the resulting 3,108 POINT features into a single MULTIPOINT feature\nSince these are point objects, the difference between union/combine is mute\n\n\ncentroid &lt;- conus %&gt;%\n  st_centroid() %&gt;%\n  st_combine()\n\n\n\nStep 1.3\nMake a voronoi tessellation over your county centroids (MULTIPOINT)\n\nvoronoi &lt;- st_voronoi(centroid, envelope = st_union(conus)) %&gt;%\n  st_collection_extract(\"POLYGON\") %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf() %&gt;%\n  mutate(id = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  st_cast()\n\nMake a triangulated tessellation over your county centroids (MULTIPOINT)\n\ntriangulated &lt;- st_triangulate(centroid) %&gt;%\n  st_collection_extract(\"POLYGON\") %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf() %&gt;%\n  mutate(id = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  st_cast()\n\nMake a gridded coverage with n = 70, over your counties object\n\ngrid &lt;- st_make_grid(conus, n = 70, what = \"polygons\", square = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf() %&gt;%\n  mutate(id = row_number ()) %&gt;%\n  st_cast()\n\nMake a hexagonal coverage with n = 70, over your counties object In addition to creating these 4 coverage’s we need to add an ID to each tile.\n\nhex &lt;- st_make_grid(conus, n = 70, what = \"polygons\", square = FALSE) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf() %&gt;%\n  mutate(id = row_number ()) %&gt;%\n  st_cast()\n\n\n\nStep 1.4\nIf you plot the above tessellations you’ll see the triangulated surfaces produce regions far beyond the boundaries of CONUS.\nWe need to cut these boundaries to CONUS border.\nTo do this, we will call on st_intersection, but will first need a geometry of CONUS to serve as our differencing feature. We can get this by unioning our existing county boundaries.\n\nunion &lt;- st_union(conus) \n\nvoronoi_union &lt;- st_intersection(voronoi, union)\n\ntriangulated_union &lt;- st_intersection(triangulated, union)\n\ngrid_union &lt;- st_intersection(grid, union)\n\nhex_union &lt;- st_intersection(hex, union)\n\n\n\nStep 1.5\nWith a single feature boundary, we must carefully consider the complexity of the geometry. Remember, the more points our geometry contains, the more computations needed for spatial predicates our differencing. For a task like ours, we do not need a finely resolved coastal boarder.\nTo achieve this:\n\nSimplify your unioned border using the Visvalingam algorithm provided by rmapshaper::ms_simplify.\nChoose what percentage of vertices to retain using the keep argument and work to find the highest number that provides a shape you are comfortable with for the analysis:\n\n\nsimple &lt;- ms_simplify(\n  union,\n  keep = .05, \n  method = \"vis\",\n  weighting = 0.7,\n  keep_shapes = FALSE,\n  no_repair = FALSE,\n  snap = TRUE,\n  explode = FALSE,\n  drop_null_geometries = TRUE,\n  snap_interval = NULL)\n\n\nOnce you are happy with your simplification, use the mapview::npts function to report the number of points in your original object, and the number of points in your simplified object.\n\n\nmapview::npts(union)\n\n[1] 11292\n\nmapview::npts(simple)\n\n[1] 577\n\n\n\nHow many points were you able to remove? What are the consequences of doing this computationally?\n\n10,715 points.

The uniform shape helps avoid the issues of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), which can mess with analysis when shapes vary too much. It also works well for visualizing the concentration in the Midwest and South, and it’s more computationally efficient for larger datasets."

Does it make sense? How might the tessellation you chose impact your findings? How does the distribution of dams coincide with other geographic factors such as river systems, climate, ect?\nIrrigation dams are most concentrated around what looks like Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and Texas. That makes sense, as these areas divert water for irrigation. Hydroelectric dams are concentrated in the Northeast and West Coast. This makes sense, as the states that produce the most hydropower are Washington, New York, California, and Oregon. Flood Control dams are concentrated around the Midwest and seem to be in areas that the Mississippi River runs through. Finally, water supply dams are scattered. They may represent areas with high population or with high agricultural water needs."

    "text": "Step 3 - Identifying the Relevant Images\nThe next step is to identify the images that are available for our AOI and time range. This is where the rstac package comes in. The rstac package provides a simple interface to the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) API, which is a standard for discovering and accessing geospatial data.\nSTAC is a specification for describing geospatial data in a consistent way, making it easier to discover and access datasets. It provides a standardized way to describe the metadata of geospatial assets, including their spatial and temporal extents, data formats, and other relevant information.\n\nCatalog: A catalog is a collection of STAC items and collections. It serves as a top-level container for organizing and managing geospatial data. A catalog can contain multiple collections, each representing a specific dataset or group of related datasets.\nItems: The basic unit of data in STAC. Each item represents a single asset, such as a satellite image or a vector dataset. Items contain metadata that describes the asset, including its spatial and temporal extents, data format, and other relevant information.\nAsset: An asset is a specific file or data product associated with an item. For example, a single satellite image may have multiple assets, such as different bands or processing levels. Assets are typically stored in a cloud storage system and can be accessed via URLs.\n\nFor this project we are going to use a STAC catalog to identify the data available for our analysis. We want data from the Landsat 8 collection which is served by the USGS (via AWS), Google, and Microsoft Planetary Computer (MPC). MPC is the one that provides free access so we will use that data store.\nIf you go to this link you see the JSON representation of the full data holdings. If you CMD/CTL+F on that page for Landsat you’ll find the references for the available data stores.\nWithin R, we can open a connection to this endpoint with the stac function:\n\n# Open a connection to the MPC STAC API\n(stac_query &lt;- stac(\"https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1\"))\n\n###rstac_query\n- url: https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1/\n- params:\n- field(s): version, base_url, endpoint, params, verb, encode\n\n\nThat connection will provide an open entry to ALL data hosted by MPC. The stac_search function allows us to reduce the catalog to assets that match certain criteria (just like dplyr::filter reduces a data.frame). The get_request() function sends your search to the STAC API returning the metadata about the objects that match a criteria. The service implementation at MPC sets a return limit of 250 items (but it could be overridden with the limit parameter).\nHere, we are interested in the “Landsat Collection 2 Level-2” data. From the JSON file (seen in the browser). To start, lets search for that collection using the stac -&gt; stac_search –&gt; get_request workflow:\n\n(stac_query &lt;-stac(\"https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1\") |&gt; \n  stac_search(\n    collections = \"landsat-c2-l2\") |&gt; \n  get_request())\n\n###Items\n- features (250 item(s)):\n  - LC09_L2SP_089090_20250506_02_T1\n  - LC09_L2SP_089089_20250506_02_T1\n  - LC09_L2SP_089088_20250506_02_T2\n  - LC09_L2SP_089087_20250506_02_T2\n  - LC09_L2SP_089086_20250506_02_T1\n  - LC09_L2SP_089085_20250506_02_T1\n  - LC09_L2SP_089084_20250506_02_T1\n  - LC09_L2SP_089083_20250506_02_T1\n  - LC09_L2SP_089082_20250506_02_T1\n  - LC09_L2SP_089081_20250506_02_T1\n  - ... with 240 more feature(s).\n- assets: \nang, atran, blue, cdist, coastal, drad, emis, emsd, green, lwir11, mtl.json, mtl.txt, mtl.xml, nir08, qa, qa_aerosol, qa_pixel, qa_radsat, red, rendered_preview, swir16, swir22, tilejson, trad, urad\n- item's fields: \nassets, bbox, collection, geometry, id, links, properties, stac_extensions, stac_version, type\n\n\nAwesome! So the first 250 items from the Level-2 Landsat collection were returned. Within each item, there are a number of assets (e.g. the red, green, blue bands) and all items have some associated fields like the sub item assets, the bounding box, etc. We can now refine our search to limit the returned results to those that cover our AOI and time range of interest:\n\n(stac_query &lt;- stac(\"https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1\") |&gt; \n  stac_search(\n    collections = \"landsat-c2-l2\",\n    datetime    = temporal_range,\n    bbox        = st_bbox(palo)) |&gt; \n  get_request())\n\n###Items\n- features (2 item(s)):\n  - LC08_L2SP_025031_20160926_02_T1\n  - LE07_L2SP_026031_20160925_02_T1\n- assets: \nang, atmos_opacity, atran, blue, cdist, cloud_qa, coastal, drad, emis, emsd, green, lwir, lwir11, mtl.json, mtl.txt, mtl.xml, nir08, qa, qa_aerosol, qa_pixel, qa_radsat, red, rendered_preview, swir16, swir22, tilejson, trad, urad\n- item's fields: \nassets, bbox, collection, geometry, id, links, properties, stac_extensions, stac_version, type\n\n\nBy adding these constraints, we now see just two items. One from the Landsat 7 Level 2 dataset, and one from the Landsat 8 Level 2 dataset. For this lab, lets focus on the Landsat 8 item. We can use either the item or the id search criteria to elect this:\n\n(stac_query &lt;- stac(\"https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1\") |&gt; \n  stac_search(\n    collections = \"landsat-c2-l2\",\n    datetime    = temporal_range,\n    bbox        = st_bbox(palo),\n    limit = 1) |&gt; \n  get_request())\n\n###Items\n- features (1 item(s)):\n  - LC08_L2SP_025031_20160926_02_T1\n- assets: \nang, atran, blue, cdist, coastal, drad, emis, emsd, green, lwir11, mtl.json, mtl.txt, mtl.xml, nir08, qa, qa_aerosol, qa_pixel, qa_radsat, red, rendered_preview, swir16, swir22, tilejson, trad, urad\n- item's fields: \nassets, bbox, collection, geometry, id, links, properties, stac_extensions, stac_version, type\n\n\n\n## OR ## \n\n(stac_query &lt;- stac(\"https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1\") |&gt; \n  stac_search(\n    id = 'LC08_L2SP_025031_20160926_02_T1',\n    collections = \"landsat-c2-l2\",\n    datetime    = temporal_range,\n    bbox        = st_bbox(palo)) |&gt; \n  get_request())\n\n###Items\n- features (1 item(s)):\n  - LC08_L2SP_025031_20160926_02_T1\n- assets: \nang, atran, blue, cdist, coastal, drad, emis, emsd, green, lwir11, mtl.json, mtl.txt, mtl.xml, nir08, qa, qa_aerosol, qa_pixel, qa_radsat, red, rendered_preview, swir16, swir22, tilejson, trad, urad\n- item's fields: \nassets, bbox, collection, geometry, id, links, properties, stac_extensions, stac_version, type\n\n\nThe last thing we need to do, is sign this request. In rstac, items_sign(sign_planetary_computer()) signs STAC item asset URLs retrieved from Microsoft’s Planetary Computer, ensuring they include authentication tokens for access. sign_planetary_computer() generates the necessary signing function, and items_sign() applies it to STAC items. This is essential for accessing datasets hosted on the Planetary Computer, and other catalog were data access might be requester-paid or limited.\n\n(stac_query &lt;- stac(\"https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1\") |&gt; \n  stac_search(\n    collections = \"landsat-c2-l2\",\n    datetime    = temporal_range,\n    bbox        = st_bbox(palo),\n    limit = 1) |&gt; \n  get_request() |&gt; \n  items_sign(sign_planetary_computer()))\n\n###Items\n- features (1 item(s)):\n  - LC08_L2SP_025031_20160926_02_T1\n- assets: \nang, atran, blue, cdist, coastal, drad, emis, emsd, green, lwir11, mtl.json, mtl.txt, mtl.xml, nir08, qa, qa_aerosol, qa_pixel, qa_radsat, red, rendered_preview, swir16, swir22, tilejson, trad, urad\n- item's fields: \nassets, bbox, collection, geometry, id, links, properties, stac_extensions, stac_version, type"

Alternatively, the Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) bands are useful for discerning what is wet and dry.\nWhen working with Landsat imagery, a logical first step is to load an image into an image analysis program (like ENVI) to visualize whats in the scene. We can do the same thing with R using the plotRGB function and selecting which band should populate each channel.\nstretching is a common technique used to enhance the contrast of an image by adjusting the brightness and contrast of the pixel values. This is done by mapping the pixel values to a new range, which can help to highlight certain features in the image. In R, the stretch argument in the plotRGB function allows you to apply different stretching methods to enhance the visual appearance of the image. Test the different stretch options (“lin” and “hist”) and see how they affect the image.\nFor question 2, make four unique combinations:\nR-G-B (natural color) NIR-R-G (fa) (color infared) NIR-SWIR1-R (false color water focus) Your choice What does each image allow you to see?\n\nnatural_color &lt;- plotRGB(palo_crop, r = 4, g = 3, b = 2, stretch = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnatural_color\n# as close to true color as you can get\n# vegetation is green, water is blue or black, urban areas are gray or brown, soil is brown or tan\n# no stretch with raw values\n\nCIR &lt;- plotRGB(palo_crop, r = 5, g = 4, b = 3, stretch = \"lin\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCIR\n# good for visualizing vegetation in red\n# vegetation is red, water is blue or black, urban areas are light green, soil is orange or brown\n# stretch uses linear scaling to enhance contrast\n\nfalse_color &lt;- plotRGB(palo_crop, r=5, g=6, b=4, stretch = \"hist\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfalse_color\n# good for visualizing land and water\n# vegetation is red, water is blue or black, urban areas are green or yellow, soil is yellow or orange\n# stretch based on histogram and will emphasise certain features\n\nfalse_color_ag &lt;- plotRGB(palo_crop, r=6, g=5, b=2, stretch = \"q95\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfalse_color_ag\n# agricultural vegetation shows up bright green\n# vegetation is green, water is blue or black, urban areas are purple or brown, soil is brown or tan\n# stretch based on 95th percentile and removes outliers"

Supervised classification groups values (cells) based on user supplied “truth” locations. Since flood events are fast-occurring there is rarely truth points for a live event. Instead developers rely on libraries of flood spectral signatures.\nUnsupervised classification finds statistically significant groupings within the data. In these clustering algorithms, the user specifies the number of classes and the categorization is created based on the patterns in the data.\nFor this lab we will use a simple k-means algorithm to group raster cells with similar spectral properties.\n\nStep 1\nAnytime we want to be able to produce a consistent/reproducible result from a random process in R we need to set a seed.

You now have a categorical raster with categories 1:k. The issue is we don’t know the value that corresponds to the flood water. To identify the flood category programatically, generate a table crossing the values of one of your binary flood rasters, with the values of your kmeans_raster. To do this, you will use the table function and pass it the values from a binary flood raster, and the values from your kmeans_raster. Here the following occurs:\n\ntable builds a contingency table counting the number of times each combination of factor levels in the input vector(s) occurs. This will give us a table quantifying how many cells with a value 1 are aligned with each of the k classes, and how many cells with a value 0 are aligned with each of the k classes. If you pass the binary flood values as the first argument to table then the unique values (0,1) will be the rows. They will always be sorted meaning you know the flooded cells will be in the second row.\nwhich.max() returns the index of the maximum value in a vector.\ncombine this information to identify the cluster in the kmeans data that coincides with the most flooded cells in the binary mask.\nOnce you know this value, use app to extract the flood mask in a similar way to the thresholding you did above.\nFinally add this to add to your flood raster stack with c() and make a new plot!\n\n\nflood_table &lt;- table(NDWI_t[], km_raster[])\nprint(flood_table)\n\n   \n       1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12\n  0  717  959 1088 1245 2411  508  734 1338 1121  422  122  721\n  1    0    1    0    0    0    3    0    0    0  802    0    0\n\nwhich.max(flood_table)\n\n[1] 9\n\nflood_class &lt;- 1\n\nflood_raster &lt;- km_raster\nvalues(flood_raster) &lt;- ifelse(values(flood_raster) == flood_class, 1, 0)\n\nplot(flood_raster, col = c(\"white\", \"blue\"), main = \"Flooded Cells (K-means)\")"

You can then use the resolution of the cell to convert counts to a flooded area.\n\nPrint these values\n\nflooded_cells &lt;- global(binary_stack, fun = \"sum\", na.rm = TRUE)\n\nprint(flooded_cells)\n\n       sum\nNDVI   926\nNDWI   806\nMNDWI 1335\nWRI   1062\nSWI    869\n\ncell_res &lt;- res(binary_stack) \n\ncell_area &lt;- cell_res[1] * cell_res[2] \n\nflooded_area &lt;- flooded_cells$sum * cell_area\n\ndata.frame(\n  Layer = rownames(flooded_cells),\n  Flooded_Cells = flooded_cells$sum,\n  Flooded_Area_m2 = flooded_area)\n\n  Layer Flooded_Cells Flooded_Area_m2\n1  NDVI           926          833400\n2  NDWI           806          725400\n3 MNDWI          1335         1201500\n4   WRI          1062          955800\n5   SWI           869          782100\n\n\n\nSecond we can visualize the uncertainty in our classifications by summing the entire stack using app. The higher the count in each pixel, the more certain we can be about its flooded state. For example, if a cell has a value of 6, it indicates that every method identified the cell as flooded, if it has a value of 2 then we know that two of the methods identified the cell as flooded.\n\nPlot your flood map using the blues9 color palette\n\ncertainty &lt;- app(binary_stack, fun = sum)\n\nplot(certainty, \n     main = \"Flooded Area Classification Certainty\", \n     colramp = colorRampPalette(blues9),\n     breaks = seq(-0.5, 5.5, by = 1),\n     legend = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird once you have a summed raster layer, copy it as a new layer, and set all 0 values to NA. Then map the raster with mapview. Zoom and pan around the interactive map noting that a pixel level is displayed in the upper right hand corner.\n\n\ncertainty_copy &lt;- certainty\n\ncertainty_copy[certainty_copy == 0] &lt;- NA\n\nblues &lt;- brewer.pal(9, \"Blues\")[2:9]  # Skip the lightest 3 colors\n\ncolor_blues &lt;- colorRampPalette(blues)\n\nmapview(certainty_copy, \n        main = \"Flooded Area Classification Certainty\", \n        layer.name = \"Flood Certainty\", \n        col.regions = color_blues,\n        na.color = NA) \n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are some of the cell values not an even number? I think it is because the indices raster considers 5 different thresholds.\nCongratulations! You have successfully carried out a complete flood analysis from data acquisition through evaluation. This kind of work goes on regularly and is part of a couple national efforts (NOAA, USGS, FirstStreet, FEMA) to generate flood inundation libraries that contribute to better extraction and classification of realtime flood events, resource allocation during events, and damage assessments post events.\nHere we used Landsat imagery but the same process could be implemented on drone footage, MODIS data, or other private satellite imagery.\nYour evaluation was based purely on the raster data structure and your ability to conceptualize rasters as vectors of data with dimensional structure. You applied simple mathematical operators (+, /, -) to the raster bands, and a kmeans clustering algorithm to the data matrix of the multiband raster - all within ~100 lines of code!"

Here, we are asking walk2 to pass the first element of remote_files and the first element of local_files to the download.file function to download the data, and setting quiet = TRUE to suppress output. The process is then iterated for the second element of each vector, and so on.\n\n\nwalk2(remote_files, local_files, download.file, quiet = TRUE)\n\n\nOnce downloaded, the data can be read it into R using readr::read_delim(), again instead of applying this to each file individually, we can use map to apply the function to each element of the local_files list.\n\n\n# Read and merge data\ncamels &lt;- map(local_files, read_delim, show_col_types = FALSE) \n\n\nThis gives us a list of data.frames, one for each file that we want to merge into a single table. So far in class we have focused on *_join functions to merge data based on a primary and foreign key relationship.\n\nIn this current list, we have &gt;2 tables, but, have a shared column called gauge_id that we can use to merge the data. However, since we have more then a left and right hand table, we need a more robust tool. We will use the powerjoin package to merge the data into a single data frame. powerjoin is a flexible package for joining lists of data.frames. It provides a wide range of join types, including inner, left, right, full, semi, anti, and cross joins making it a versatile tool for data manipulation and analysis, and one that should feel familiar to users of dplyr.\nIn this case, we are join to merge every data.frame in the list (n = 6) by the shared gauge_id column. Since we want to keep all data, we want a full join.\n\ncamels &lt;- power_full_join(camels ,by = 'gauge_id')\n\nAlternatively, we could have read straight form the urls. Strongly consider the implications of this approach as the longevity and persistence of the data is not guaranteed.\n\n# Read and merge data\ncamels &lt;- map(remote_files, read_delim, show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt; \n  power_full_join(by = 'gauge_id')"

    "text": "Visual EDA\n\nLets start by looking that the 3 dimensions (variables) of this data. We’ll start with a XY plot of aridity and rainfall. We are going to use the scale_color_viridis_c() function to color the points by the q_mean column. This scale functions maps the color of the points to the values in the q_mean column along the viridis continuous (c) palette. Because a scale_color_* function is applied, it maps to the known color aesthetic in the plot.\n\n\n# Create a scatter plot of aridity vs rainfall\nggplot(camels, aes(x = aridity, y = p_mean)) +\n  # Add points colored by mean flow\n  geom_point(aes(color = q_mean)) +\n  # Add a linear regression line\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", linetype = 2) +\n  # Apply the viridis color scale\n  scale_color_viridis_c() +\n  # Add a title, axis labels, and theme (w/ legend on the bottom)\n  theme_linedraw() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") + \n  labs(title = \"Aridity vs Rainfall vs Runnoff\", \n       x = \"Aridity\", \n       y = \"Rainfall\",\n       color = \"Mean Flow\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk! so it looks like there is a relationship between rainfall, aridity, and rainfall but it looks like an exponential decay function and is certainly not linear.\nTo test a transformation, we can log transform the x and y axes using the scale_x_log10() and scale_y_log10() functions:\n\nggplot(camels, aes(x = aridity, y = p_mean)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = q_mean)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_c() +\n  # Apply log transformations to the x and y axes\n  scale_x_log10() + \n  scale_y_log10() +\n  theme_linedraw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") + \n  labs(title = \"Aridity vs Rainfall vs Runnoff\", \n       x = \"Aridity\", \n       y = \"Rainfall\",\n       color = \"Mean Flow\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat! We can see a log-log relationship between aridity and rainfall provides a more linear relationship. This is a common relationship in hydrology and is often used to estimate rainfall in ungauged basins. However, once the data is transformed, the lack of spread in the streamflow data is quite evident with high mean flow values being compressed to the low end of aridity/high end of rainfall.\nTo address this, we can visualize how a log transform may benifit the q_mean data as well. Since the data is represented by color, rather then an axis, we can use the trans (transform) argument in the scale_color_viridis_c() function to log transform the color scale.\n\nggplot(camels, aes(x = aridity, y = p_mean)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = q_mean)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  # Apply a log transformation to the color scale\n  scale_color_viridis_c(trans = \"log\") +\n  scale_x_log10() + \n  scale_y_log10() +\n  theme_linedraw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        # Expand the legend width ...\n        legend.key.width = unit(2.5, \"cm\"),\n        legend.key.height = unit(.5, \"cm\")) + \n  labs(title = \"Aridity vs Rainfall vs Runnoff\", \n       x = \"Aridity\", \n       y = \"Rainfall\",\n       color = \"Mean Flow\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent! Treating these three right skewed variables as log transformed, we can see a more evenly spread relationship between aridity, rainfall, and mean flow. This is a good sign for building a model to predict mean flow using aridity and rainfall."

Separately we have used the recipe function to define a series of data preprocessing steps. Here, we are going to use the recipe function to define a series of data preprocessing steps.\nWe learned quite a lot about the data in the visual EDA. We know that the q_mean, aridity and p_mean columns are right skewed and can be helped by log transformations. We also know that the relationship between aridity and p_mean is non-linear and can be helped by adding an interaction term to the model. To implement these, lets build a recipe!\n\n# Create a recipe to preprocess the data\nrec &lt;-  recipe(logQmean ~ aridity + p_mean, data = camels_train) %&gt;%\n  # Log transform the predictor variables (aridity and p_mean)\n  step_log(all_predictors()) %&gt;%\n  # Add an interaction term between aridity and p_mean\n  step_interact(terms = ~ aridity:p_mean) |&gt; \n  # Drop any rows with missing values in the pred\n  step_naomit(all_predictors(), all_outcomes())\n\n\n\nNaive base lm approach:\nOk, to start, lets do what we are comfortable with … fitting a linear model to the data.

It really doesnt matter how well it does on data it has already seen!\nWe have to be careful about how we do this with the base R approach:\n\nWrong version 1: augment\nThe broom package provides a convenient way to extract model predictions and residuals. We can use the augment function to add predicted values to the test data. However, if we use augment directly on the test data, we will get incorrect results because the preprocessing steps defined in the recipe object have not been applied to the test data.\n\nnrow(camels_test)\n\n[1] 135\n\nnrow(camels_train)\n\n[1] 536\n\nbroom::augment(lm_base, new_data = camels_test)\n\n# A tibble: 535 × 9\n   logQmean aridity p_mean .fitted  .resid    .hat .sigma    .cooksd .std.resid\n      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 -0.0230   -0.172  1.18    0.107 -0.130  0.00252  0.570 0.0000328     -0.228 \n 2 -0.496     0.481  1.08   -0.549  0.0534 0.0179   0.570 0.0000408      0.0945\n 3  0.530    -0.362  1.44    0.631 -0.101  0.00367  0.570 0.0000291     -0.178 \n 4  0.314     0.573  0.665  -1.26   1.57   0.00562  0.566 0.0108         2.76  \n 5  0.658    -0.466  1.28    0.470  0.188  0.00422  0.570 0.000116       0.331 \n 6  0.00495  -0.146  1.33    0.308 -0.303  0.00475  0.570 0.000339      -0.533 \n 7 -0.0146   -0.135  0.871  -0.376  0.362  0.00847  0.570 0.000868       0.638 \n 8  0.413    -0.338  1.29    0.389  0.0238 0.00264  0.570 0.00000116     0.0419\n 9  1.12     -0.402  1.52    0.769  0.349  0.00479  0.570 0.000454       0.614 \n10  0.552    -0.506  1.34    0.591 -0.0388 0.00378  0.570 0.00000442    -0.0682\n# ℹ 525 more rows\n\n\n\n\nWrong version 2: predict\nThe predict function can be used to make predictions on new data.

This ensures the test data is transformed in the same way as the training data before making predictions.\n\ntest_data &lt;-  bake(prep(rec), new_data = camels_test)\ntest_data$lm_pred &lt;- predict(lm_base, newdata = test_data)\n\n\n\n\nModel Evaluation: statistical and visual\nNow that we have the predicted values, we can evaluate the model using the metrics function from the yardstick package.

The workflows package allows you to define a series of modeling steps, including data preprocessing, model fitting, and model fitting, in a single object. This makes it easier to experiment with different models, compare performance, and ensure reproducibility.\nworkflows are built from a model, a preprocessor, and a execution. Here, we are going to use the linear_reg function to define a linear regression model, set the engine to lm, and the mode to regression. We then add our recipe to the workflow, fit the model to the training data, and extract the model coefficients.\n\n# Define model\nlm_model &lt;- linear_reg() %&gt;%\n  # define the engine\n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;%\n  # define the mode\n  set_mode(\"regression\")\n\n# Instantiate a workflow ...\nlm_wf &lt;- workflow() %&gt;%\n  # Add the recipe\n  add_recipe(rec) %&gt;%\n  # Add the model\n  add_model(lm_model) %&gt;%\n  # Fit the model to the training data\n  fit(data = camels_train) \n\n# Extract the model coefficients from the workflow\nsummary(extract_fit_engine(lm_wf))$coefficients\n\n                   Estimate Std.

Here, we are going to instead use a random forest model to predict mean streamflow. We define a random forest model using the rand_forest function, set the engine to ranger, and the mode to regression. We then add the recipe, fit the model, and evaluate the skill.\n\nrf_model &lt;- rand_forest() %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"ranger\", importance = \"impurity\") %&gt;%\n  set_mode(\"regression\")\n\nrf_wf &lt;- workflow() %&gt;%\n  # Add the recipe\n  add_recipe(rec) %&gt;%\n  # Add the model\n  add_model(rf_model) %&gt;%\n  # Fit the model\n  fit(data = camels_train) \n\n\n\nPredictions\nMake predictions on the test data using the augment function and the new_data argument.\n\nrf_data &lt;- augment(rf_wf, new_data = camels_test)\ndim(rf_data)\n\n[1] 135  61\n\n\n\n\nModel Evaluation: statistical and visual\nEvaluate the model using the metrics function and create a scatter plot of the observed vs predicted values, colored by aridity.\n\nmetrics(rf_data, truth = logQmean, estimate = .pred)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  .metric .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 rmse    standard       0.596\n2 rsq     standard       0.733\n3 mae     standard       0.370\n\n\n\nggplot(rf_data, aes(x = logQmean, y = .pred, colour = aridity)) +\n  scale_color_viridis_c() +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline() +\n  theme_linedraw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome! We just set up a completely new model and were able to utilize all of the things we had done for the linear model. This is the power of the tidymodels framework!\nThat said, we still can reduce some to the repetition. Further, we are not really able to compare these models to one another as they\n\n\nA workflowset approach\nworkflow_set is a powerful tool for comparing multiple models on the same data. It allows you to define a set of workflows, fit them to the same data, and evaluate their performance using a common metric. Here, we are going to create a workflow_set object with the linear regression and random forest models, fit them to the training data, and compare their performance using the autoplot and rank_results functions.\n\nwf &lt;- workflow_set(list(rec), list(lm_model, rf_model)) %&gt;%\n  workflow_map('fit_resamples', resamples = camels_cv) \n\nautoplot(wf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrank_results(wf, rank_metric = \"rsq\", select_best = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 9\n  wflow_id          .config .metric  mean std_err     n preprocessor model  rank\n  &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 recipe_rand_fore… Prepro… rmse    0.565  0.0243    10 recipe       rand…     1\n2 recipe_rand_fore… Prepro… rsq     0.770  0.0255    10 recipe       rand…     1\n3 recipe_linear_reg Prepro… rmse    0.569  0.0260    10 recipe       line…     2\n4 recipe_linear_reg Prepro… rsq     0.770  0.0223    10 recipe       line…     2\n\n\nOverall it seems the random forest model is outperforming the linear model. This is not surprising given the non-linear relationship between the predictors and the outcome :)"
